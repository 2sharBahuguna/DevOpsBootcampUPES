### Todayâ€™s agenda

- Bare metal systems
- Virtual machines
- Containers
- Building containers from scratch.
- Introducing Docker

## Bare metal systems

- Applications are typically executed directly on the OS system.
- There is no "virtualized" layer, everything is running on the same environment.
- This is how you usually work on your machine.

## Bare metal systems disadvantages


- Dependency Conflicts
- Resource Underutilization
- Limited Scalability
- Lack of Flexibility
- High Maintenance Overhead
- Limited Fault Isolation

## Virtual machines

Virtual machines (VMs) are an abstraction layer that enables the creation and operation of multiple isolated instances of virtual hardware within a single physical host.

- The **Hypervisor** partitions the host resources and allows each VM to have its own virtualized hardware.
- **Type 1** Hypervisor is loaded directly on the hardware: [Linux KVM](https://www.linux-kvm.org/page/Main_Page), [Windows Hyper-V](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/virtualization/hyper-v-on-windows/about/)
- **Type 2** Hypervisor loaded in an OS running  on the hardware: [VMwere](https://www.vmware.com/), [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)

## IT Challenges Before Virtualization

- Data centers are out of space
- AC power panels are out of capacity
- Backups are slow and expensive
- Server utilization is VERY LOW
- Administrators are struggling with troubleshooting
- Load balancing for all applications is nearly impossible

## VMs offer several advantages


- Isolation
- Hardware Abstraction
- Operating System Flexibility
- Resource Optimization
- Snapshotting and Rollbacks
- Scalability and Elasticity
- Migration and High Availability

## But...

The fact that every VM requires its own dedicated OS is a major flaw!

Every OS consumes CPU, RAM and storage that could otherwise be used to power more applications

# Container introduced

Live demo - Container from scratch

## Hello Containers

Instead of virtualizing at the hardware layer, containers are an abstraction at the app layer that packages code and dependencies together.

- Containers utilize native Linux features like [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) and [namespaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_namespaces) to provide isolation while **sharing the same kernel**.
- This lightweight approach allows for faster startup times, improved resource efficiency, and easier scalability compared to traditional virtual machines.

## Containers advantages

- Lightweight and Portable
- Isolation and Resource Efficiency
- Consistent and Reproducible Builds
- Scalability and Elasticity
- DevOps and Continuous Integration/Deployment (CI/CD)

[comment]: # (!!!)

Under the hoods, containers are merely a **linux processes**

That "lives" in an **loosely** isolated environment.

## Introducing Docker


Docker is an open platform for developing, building and shipping images, and running containers.
