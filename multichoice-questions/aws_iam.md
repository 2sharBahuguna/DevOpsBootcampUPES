# AWS - IAM - multichoice questions

### Question 1 

Which of the below actions can be controlled with IAM policies?

1. Creating an Amazon S3 bucket.
2. Control who can SSH into an EC2 instance.
3. Control the name of an EC2 instance.
4. Control the time in which IAM user can login to the web console. 

### Question 2

Which of the following statements best describes how a request to AWS in authorized?

1. The request is default denied, but this can be overridden by an allow. In contrast, if a policy explicitly denies a request, it can be overridden but only by certain requests.
2. The request is default denied, but this can be overridden by an allow. In contrast, if a policy explicitly denies a request, that deny can't be overridden.
3. The request can either be allowed or denied depending on the request and each can be overwritten by the other. In contrast, if a policy explicitly denies a request, that deny can't be overridden.
4. The request is default allowed, but this can be overridden by a deny. In contrast, if a policy explicitly denies a request, that deny can't be overridden.

### Question 3

Your AWS account has 350 IAM users.
Your product manager asks you to allow to 50 users full access on S3. 
How can you implement this **effectively**?

1. Create an IAM group, add the 50 users, and apply the policy to group.
2. Create a policy and apply it to multiple users using a Bash script.
3. Create an S3 bucket policy with unlimited access which includes each user's AWS account ID.
4. Create a new role and add each user to the IAM role.

### Question 4

What does the following policy for Amazon EC2 do?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": {
    "Effect": "Deny",
    "Action": "*",
    "Resource": "*",
    "Condition": {
      "NotIpAddress": {
        "aws:SourceIp": [
          "192.0.2.0/24",
          "203.0.113.0/24"
        ]
      },
      "Bool": {"aws:ViaAWSService": "false"}
    }
  }
}
```

1. Allow users with the above source IP to access resources.
2. Denies access to AWS based on the source IP, even for AWS resources who try to access other resources.
3. Denies access to AWS based on the source IP.
4. Denies access from EC2 instance to the above IP ranges.

### Question 5 

What does the below policy do?

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:DescribeInstances",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroups",
        "ec2:DescribeSecurityGroupReferences",
        "ec2:DescribeStaleSecurityGroups"
      ],
      "Resource": "*",
      "Effect": "Allow"
    },
    {
      "Action": [
        "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupEgress",
        "ec2:AuthorizeSecurityGroupIngress",
        "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupEgress",
        "ec2:RevokeSecurityGroupIngress",
        "ec2:StartInstances",
        "ec2:StopInstances"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:instance/*",
        "arn:aws:ec2:*:*:security-group/*"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
  ]
}
```

1. Allows starting or stopping an EC2 instance and creating a security group.
2. Allows starting or stopping an EC2 instance and modifying a security group.
3. Allows starting or stopping an EC2 instance and deleting a security group.
4. Allows creating an EC2 instance and modifying a security group.

### Question 6

You EC2 instance should read objects from `mybucket` S3 bucket.
Your instance assumes a role with the following policy: 

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": [
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::mybucket"
    }
  ]
}
```

However, when the app running in the EC2 tries to read object, you receive the error: 

```text
Action does not apply to any resource(s) in statement.
```

How can you fix the error?

1. Change the IAM permissions by applying `PutBucketPolicy` permissions.
2. Verify that the policy has the same name as the EC2 instance.
3. Add ``arn:aws:s3:::mybucket/*`` to the `Resource` section.
4. Add an action `s3:ListBucket`.

### Question 7

An IAM user is trying to perform an action on an object belonging to some other accountâ€™s S3 bucket.

Which of the bellow permission(s) would result a successful action?

1. Identity based policy which allow the users to perform operation on S3 buckets.
2. Only the root user account can perform this kind of operation. 
3. Allow the user to access the other account's bucket using permission boundaries. 
4. Resource based policy on the bucket which grant permission on the user's account.
